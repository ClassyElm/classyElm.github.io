                                    The Minecraft JSON generator was developed to make it easier to
                                    write custom tellraw commands without having to memorize
                                    Minecraft-specific JSON components. The tellraw commands that
                                    are generated can be run directly within Minecraft and will
                                    display a formatted text chat message in the multiplayer chat.

                                    This project was developed using PHP and MySQL. To host the web
                                    application, I used Internet Information Services (IIS), but
                                    the configuration for the web server was omitted.

                                    Similar to the first version, the second version of the
                                    Minecraft Tellraw JSON Generator set out to make writing JSON
                                    for commands in Minecraft easier. This time, however, there
                                    were more features that I had wanted to implement for even more
                                    usability and organization.

                                    The project went through the entire design and development
                                    process. It was designed using Figma and it was developed
                                    in Java 11 using a variety of APIs (Gson, Mojang API, Javax
                                    Servlets, etc.). The website was hosted with Tomcat Enterprise
                                    Edition and ultimately deployed on Amazon Web Services.

                                    The RESTful CSV to JSON Parser is a public API that was hosted
                                    through AWS on an EC2 instance. It provided the service of
                                    CSV to JSON conversion, as well as documentation for outside
                                    use of the API. Additionally, it provided the option to filter
                                    the returned JSON using a variety of built-in filtering options
                                    and support for both REGEX and the <a href="https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath">JsonPath API</a>.

                                    The project was modeled using the MVC design pattern and
                                    included two major endpoints that could be utilized for
                                    submitting raw CSV data and returning a filtered JSON
                                    representation of that data. This project was a collaboration
                                    on a three-person development team for an Enterprise Java
                                    course at Madison College.
