                In my free time, I enjoy doing many computer-related things,
                including electronic and PC repair. I also love math and
                programming so much that I have created many projects combining
                those passions. In my time working on these projects, I have
                developed many skills and knowledge in the matter. For that
                reason, I have put together a showcase of some of the noteworthy
                projects I have worked on here.
