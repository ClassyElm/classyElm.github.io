                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy doing many computer-related
                        things, including electronic and PC repair. I also love
                        math and programming so much that I have created many
                        projects combining those passions. In my time working on
                        these projects, I have developed many skills and
                        knowledge in the matter. For that reason, I have put
                        together a showcase of some of the noteworthy projects
                        I have worked on here.
